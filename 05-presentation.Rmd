# Do harvest-time agricultural shocks affect conflict?

.right-column[

Conflicts happen... everywhere and all the time. 

But in some places and at certain times more of them happen.

We focus on low- and middle-income countries of Southeast Asia, where agriculture employs and pays large shares of population, and ask the question:

> Do harvest-time agricultural shocks lead to changes in forms of conflict?

# They amplify violence and (maybe) reduce protests

.right-column[

The answer to the research question is hardly unequivocal.

Relative to the rest of the year, at harvest time we observe:
- four-to-eight percent increase in violence against civilians
- up to ten percent decrease in protests*
- excess rain during the growing season mitigates the effects
- the results are mainly driven by rainfed locations

*sensitive to data subsetting.

# Conflicts happen all across Southeast Asia

From the [ACLED Project](https://acleddata.com/), over 70 thousand incidents of: 
- <span style="color:dimgray">**battles**</span>, 
- <span style="color:dimgray">**explosions/remote violence**</span>, 
- <span style="color:indianred">**violence against civilians**</span>, 
- <span style="color:goldenrod">**riots**</span>, and 
- <span style="color:goldenrod">**protests**</span> 

observed over the 2010-2022 period.

# We study the effect of harvest on forms of conflict

.right-column[

The outcome variable is the number of conflict incidents observed at a cell in a given time. We consider:
- each form of conflict separately,
- all forms of conflict combined.

The treatment variable is the product of the cell-specific area (hectares) and harvest season (binary).

Fixed effects: cell, country $\times$ year, year-month.

Full sample consists of 44,724 observations and 71,109 incidents.

Myanmar 2021-2022 includes 1,416 (3.2%) observations and 23,550 (33.1%) conflict incidents.

# Harvest-time violence may be linked to rapacity

.right-column[

[Ubilava et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12364) investigate the effect of cereal price change on seasonal violence in the croplands of Africa.

The key finding: much of the annually accrued effect&mdash;which is positive, statistically significant, and economically meaningful&mdash;happens during the first three months of the crop year.

Accords with the *rapacity mechanism*: farmers attacked when most gains are to be made (or maximum damage incurred).

# Opportunity cost may explain less protests 

.right-column[
The *opportunity cost mechanism* often is portrayed as a trade-off a person faces between farming and fighting.

Agricultural shocks may push a person in one direction or another... but this is a longer term engagement.

In the short run, the opportunity cost mechanism is well-suited to explain the lack of protests at harvest time.
