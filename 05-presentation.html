# Agriculture and conflict are linked; sometimes literally

.right-90[

# But, more typically, possibly also causally

.right-90[

We focus on low- and middle-income countries of Southeast Asia, where agriculture employs and pays large shares of population. 

We ask the question:

&gt; Do harvest-time agricultural shocks lead to changes in forms of conflict?

]

# Harvest-time violence may be linked to rapacity

.right-90[

[Ubilava et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12364) investigate the effect of cereal price change on seasonal violence in the croplands of Africa.

The key finding: much of the annually accrued effect&amp;mdash;which is positive, statistically significant, and economically meaningful&amp;mdash;happens during the first three months of the crop year.

Accords with the *rapacity mechanism*: farmers attacked when most gains are to be made (or maximum damage incurred).

# Opportunity cost may explain less protests 

.right-90[
The *opportunity cost mechanism* often is portrayed as a trade-off a person faces between farming and fighting.

Agricultural shocks may push a person in one direction or another... but this is a longer term engagement.

In the short run, the opportunity cost mechanism is well-suited to explain the lack of protests at harvest time.

But, some of this may be offset by *resentment*, i.e., when people feel being worse off only because others are doing well.

# More violence and (maybe) less protests at harvest

.right-90[

Relative to the rest of the year, at harvest time we estimate:
- more than ten percent increase in violence against civilians
- up to ten percent increase in battles*
- up to ten percent decrease in protests*

`$$\\[.5in]$$`

*sensitive to data subsetting or changes in model specification.

# Conflicts happen all across Southeast Asia

.left-50[

From the [ACLED Project](https://acleddata.com/), over 70 thousand incidents of: 
- &lt;span style="color:dimgray"&gt;**battles**&lt;/span&gt;, 
- &lt;span style="color:dimgray"&gt;**explosions/remote violence**&lt;/span&gt;, 
- &lt;span style="color:indianred"&gt;**violence against civilians**&lt;/span&gt;, 
- &lt;span style="color:goldenrod"&gt;**riots**&lt;/span&gt;, and 
- &lt;span style="color:goldenrod"&gt;**protests**&lt;/span&gt; 

observed over the 2010-2022 period.

# Conflicts happen all the time in Southeast Asia

Unbalanced panel of eight countries.

For most countries, the data are available from 2010 onward, except for:

- Indonesia (2015-)
- Philippines (2016-)
- Malaysia (2018-)

From IFPRI's [Spatial Production Allocation Model](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V) (SPAM) and [Sacks et al. (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00551.x),
- regional variation in the sizes of harvested area
- regional variation in the timing of harvest seasons
- regional variation in the proportions of irrigated land

# Positive correlation between conflict and croplands

.left-40[

Generally positive relationship between the size of croplands and the average number of incidents in the cell

Seemingly negative relationship between these two variables in 'urban' cells

# The effect of harvest on the incidence of conflict

.right-90[

The outcome variable is the incidence of conflict in a given cell at a given period (year-month). We consider:

- all forms of conflict combined, and
- each form of conflict separately.

The treatment variable is the product of the cropland indicator (harvest area `\(\ge\)` 10,000ha) and harvest season indicator.

Fixed effects: cell, country-year, year-month.

]

---

# Battles and violence increase and protests decrease

.left-40[

The estimated effect is evaluated at the average size of the cropland and relative to the average conflict.

The dots are point estimates, and errorbars denote 95% confidence interval.

# Myanmar is driving the results

.left-40[

This comes hardly as a surprise, since nearly half of the observations come from Myanmar.

# 2020 and 2021 are driving (some of) the results

.left-40[

Likely linked with pandemic-related restrictions in 2020, and the onset of the Myanmar conflict in 2021.

# Heterogeneity: rainfed vs irrigated

.left-40[

The harvest-time increase in violence and (statistically insignificant) decrease in protests more prominent in rainfed locations.

# Heterogeneity: rural vs urban

.left-40[

The harvest-time increase in battles and violence is a rural phenomenon.

]

.right-60[

![Main Results](Figures/Extra/results_urban.png)

]

---


# Mechanisms: harvest intensity

.left-50[


The harvest-time increase in battles and violence is more prominent in larger croplands.

The harvest-time decrease in protests observed in small croplands only.

]

.right-50[

![Main Results](Figures/Extra/results_dose.png)

]

---


# Mechanisms: harvest timing

.left-50[


The harvest-time increase in battles lingers post-harvest (possibly picking up the dry-season effect).

The harvest-time increase in violence and decrease in protests are centered on the harvest month.

]

.right-50[

![Main Results](Figures/Extra/results_monthly.png)

]

---


# Mechanisms: harvest quality

.left-50[

The harvest-time increase in battles negatively correlated with the growing season rainfall.

The harvest-time decrease in violence, as well as protests and riots, have inverted V-shaped patterns relative to the growing season rainfall.
